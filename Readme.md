# Pipeline MIPS architecture implementation
>This is a modified version of the pipeline MIPS described in "Computer organization and design" by David A Patterson and John L. Hennessy. The main difference is that this is a 16 bit architecture.

>The instruction memory is assumed to have a 5 cycle memory access time. so each time instead of reading only one instruction, 4 instructions are read from the instruction memory.
